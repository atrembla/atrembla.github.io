Hi! I'm Alex, the Lead Clinical Research Coordinator in the [Biobehavioral Pediatric Pain Lab](https://bpp.stanford.edu) at [_Stanford University School of Medicine_](https://med.stanford.edu).


I graduated from Skidmore College magna cum laude in 2018 with a double major in Economics and Psychology. Before joining the Biobehavioral Pediatric Pain Lab at Stanford, I worked with Dr. Brice Kuhl in the [Kuhl Lab](https://kuhllab.com) at the [_University of Oregon_](https://www.uoregon.edu) for three years studying memory using neuroimaging techniques. I am currently working on multiple projects, including a multisite, international effort to uncover a biological signature predicting pain recovery and persistence in teens with musculoskeletal pain using neuroimaging methods. I am particularly interested in learning about how to improve research and new statistical methods. Additionally I enjoy studying  pain, affective disorders, addiction, and their neural correlates in order to better understand the cognitive processes that may contribute to the maintenance of disordered thinking.

Outside of the lab I enjoy kickboxing, dancing, cooking, and playing with Boise, my German Shepherd! I plan on applying to Clinical Psychology PhD programs in the coming years.
