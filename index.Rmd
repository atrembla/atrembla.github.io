Hi! I'm Alex, the Lead Clinical Research Coordinator in the [Biobehavioral Pediatric Pain Lab](https://bpp.stanford.edu) at [_Stanford University School of Medicine_](https://med.stanford.edu).


I graduated from Skidmore College magna cum laude in 2018 with a double major in Economics and Psychology. Before joining the Biobehavioral Pediatric Pain Lab at Stanford, I worked with Dr. Brice Kuhl in the [Kuhl Lab](https://kuhllab.com) at the [_University of Oregon_](https://www.uoregon.edu) for three years studying behavior and memory using neuroimaging techniques. I am currently working on multiple projects, including a diversity and representation manuscript, a qualitative interview study, a cerebellum fear learning data analysis, and a multisite and international effort to uncover a biological signature predicting pain recovery and persistence in teens with musculoskeletal pain using neuroimaging methods.

Outside of research I enjoy kickboxing, dancing, cooking, and playing with Boise, my German Shepherd!
