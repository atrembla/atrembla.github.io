Hi! I'm Alex, a lab manager in the [Biobehavioral Pediatric Pain Lab](https://bpp.stanford.edu) at [_Stanford University School of Medicine_](https://med.stanford.edu).


I am currently working on multiple projects including SPRINT. SPRINT is a multisite, international effort to uncover a biological signature predicting pain recovery and persistence in teens with musculoskeletal pain using neuroimaging methods. I am planning on going to graduate school to pursue a PhD in clinical psychology. Outside the lab, I enjoy playing with my German Shepherd Boise, kickboxing, cooking, and everything outdoors.


You can contact me [here](mailto:atrembla@stanford.edu) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-tremblay-mcgaw-a28774ba).
