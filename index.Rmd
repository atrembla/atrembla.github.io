Hi! I'm Alex, a Clinical Research Coordinator at the University of California, San Francisco working with [Dr. Andrew Krystal](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/andrew.krystal) in the [_Department of Psychiatry_](https://psych.ucsf.edu).


I graduated from Skidmore College magna cum laude in 2018 with a double major in Economics and Psychology. Before joining the PReSiDio Team at UCSF, I worked with Dr. Brice Kuhl in the [Kuhl Lab](https://kuhllab.com) at the [_University of Oregon_](https://www.uoregon.edu) for three years studying behavior and memory using neuroimaging techniques. After, I moved to [_Stanford University School of Medicine_](https://med.stanford.edu) where I was the Lead Clinical Research Coordinator in the [Biobehavioral Pediatric Pain Lab](https://bpp.stanford.edu). There, I worked on multiple projects, including a diversity and representation manuscript, a qualitative interview study, a cerebellum fear learning data analysis, and a multisite and international effort to uncover a biological signature predicting pain recovery and persistence in teens with musculoskeletal pain using neuroimaging methods.

Currently, I work with patients living with treatment resistant depression [_(PReSiDio Clinical Team NCT04004169)_](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04004169). I work on multiple data analysis projects including a BIOPAC/FitBit Depression biomarker augmentation analysis and a grant budget analysis.

Outside of research I enjoy kickboxing, dancing, cooking, and playing with Boise, my German Shepherd!
