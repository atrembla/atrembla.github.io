Introduction: Physical activity is essential to improve daily functioning for chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain; however, fear of movement is a documented barrier to effective engagement in physical therapy (PT). Virtual reality (VR) as a supplemental to PT has been used as a tool to augment healthy outpatients undergoing PT. However, there is limited data analyzing the effectiveness of VR as a PT supplemental for patients with MSK pain. The current investigation compares VR guided PT to standard PT with three primary aims: (1) to evaluate physical function outcomes between VR guided PT to standard PT, (2) evaluate pain-related fear as a potential mechanism of change, (3) determine the feasibility of utilizing VR in routine PT practice. This RCT study will offer a yet to be tested advancement in VR technology, by providing new treatment solutions specifically targeted at movement facilitation by way of a nonpharmacological solution.
Method: Participants with a history of chronic pain are recruited from several sites (academic medical center, managed care, private practice) within California in an effort to elicit a representative diverse participant population. Ages range from 10 to 17. Active treatment includes approximately eight one-hour VR-PT or standard PT sessions. VR sessions include real time tracking of movement to inform clinical decision-making and support tailored, point of care decisions. The primary outcome is physical function, and secondary outcome is pain-related fear. Both outcomes are assessed via daily check-in surveys and questionnaires. To assess changes in objective physical activity, participants wear actigraphy watches during their treatment period. Self-report questionnaires are completed at baseline, end of treatment, and 3-month follow-up.
Results: Findings from our pilot feasibility trial provided sufficient promise to proceed with the current RCT. Results of the feasibility study indicate that across time, significant decreases in pain (F4,27.7=9.27, P<.001), fear (F4,25.7=5.17, P=0.003), avoidance (F4,27.9=4.96, P=.004), and functional limitations (F4,25.2=4.20, P=.01).
Conclusion: Based on theory, previous research, and feasibility data, we expect participation in VR-PT to result in greater improvements in functioning compared to standard PT and that the magnitude of improvement will be associated with decreases in pain-related fear. Results of this study will provide key outcomes to evaluate this unique form of care and will inform whether it is advised to proceed with implementation of VR technology to address engagement in physical activity among youth with chronic MSK pain.
